# Layer Swipe Bundle
The Swipe Layer bundle allows you to easily compare the content of two different layers in a map using the LayerSwipe widget to reveal the content of a layer on the map. In the configuration you can choose between horizontal, vertical and scope viewing modes. In order to use the bundle "out-of-the-box" the sample app-template already provides two layers which will be used by the bundle. If you want to use your own layers please make sure to enter the map model node in the configuration of the bundle (Live Configuration -> Widgets -> Layer Swipe).
